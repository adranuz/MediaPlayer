To use POO in JS it would be better if you know some of the basic concepts 
[Constepts of POO](http://www.upv.es/amiga/43.htm) 

- Instance: is the current father object. In this way all the objects have an object father, excepts the object Object, that is the root.
- Attribute: vars that belongs to the current object.
- Method: function that belongs to the current object.
- Private: this means that you can't invoque directly an attribute or method outside of the object.
- Event: alerts that tell you that something is happening, normally there is a way to access to them.
- Class: description of the object. When you make an object with a class that will be the instance of the object.

A **Design Pattern** is the response to common problems that are normally inside the context of programming
- The context is the situation where is the error.
- The problem should appear severy times in similar situations or projects.

- The problem includes all the limitations that exists in the context: limitations in the language of framework.

- The solution could have a generic design to be used in all the technologies.

### Benefits
- Structured solutions
- Wrotten
